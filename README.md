# Snake Game

A classic Snake Game built in Java for a university assignment. Control the snake to eat fruits, grow longer, and avoid crashing into walls or into yourself. The game features an interactive intro screen with buttons, a help page, and a high score system.

This project was developed as part of a university assignment using the **GameEngine** provided by Massey University.
